# Tutorial 2

## Phase 1 - The Github Classroom

Github allows me to create starter respositories for you. I can share them through github classroom, which you will actually see as links in the course blackboard page.

We will use these for assignments, for the lab exams, and for sharing code in class.


## Phase 2 - Connecting Eclipse to your repository.

* First finishing making sure your repository is available. Find the green button on the right which will contain the string to allow you to connect to github.
* To set up the repository - in Ecliplse:
   * Go to Window -> Show View -> Other -> Git -> GitRepositories and click **open**
   * You will now see the git repository view, you can use this to connect to *remote* repositories.
   * Click on **Clone an existing Repository** (it will have the green arrow)
   * Copy the link from the repository page and past it in the box at the top of the window. Eclipse should fill in the details. You can add your *github* username and password to have eclipse not bother you with the details all the time. (Tag "Store in Secure Store".
   * Click next, to see a list of branches (which we don't care about) and next again to see the project wizard.
   * The defaults for the project wizard should be good. **Note the directory which the repository is being stored to**
